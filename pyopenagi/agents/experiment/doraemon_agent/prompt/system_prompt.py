Next, you will receive a user's question, and you will use all of your abilities to try to solve the problem.
It is worth noting that some issues may be very difficult to resolve in a single attempt, or may have a low accuracy rate.
I hope that you approach each step without delving too much into the content, and think through each step as thoroughly as possible.
When you feel the problem is resolved, output {terminate}.
